			<h1>DOM Manipulation</h1>
			<p>
				What is the DOM? DOM stads for Document Object Model. It is a way of manapulating object of an html document. It is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.
			</p>
			<h3>Adding element to the DOM</h3>
			<p>
				The are two different ways of adding an element to the page. The two ways are the append and appendchild method, we select the element we want to add to the DOM and append an element to it. In appending there is append and appendchild.    
			</p>
			<h3>Different between append and appendc child </h3>
			<p>
				The different between append and appendchild is that in append, we can append divs, spans, strig or even mltiple strings; while appendchild, we can only append divs and spans but not strings. 
			</p>
			<h3>Creating element in the DOM</h3>
			<p>
				In creating an element in the DOM, we use the document.createElement("") method and  place the element we want to create in the parenthesis. It is a key note to keep in mind that after creating an element, to make it visible we will have to add that element and to add element to the body we use body.append() and add the element name in the parenthesis like div. And if by any means we want to add a text to that div element, we use div.innerText = "Hello World".
			</p>
			<h3>Different between innerText and TextContent</h3>
			<p>
				The different between innerText and TextContent is that innerText will print the exact text content with all the spacing and all of the indentation of all the content inside the div; while innerText look at the css to see if  the item  actually visible on the screen, if it is, it gives it to us and if it's not, it dosent. It display our text just as it should display in the HTML. In Javascript, innerHTML is the only way we can add HTML from a string into an element.
			</p> 
			<h3>Removing element</h3>
			<p>Removing element from the page is done by writing the element name and the item we want to remove and call the the remove function. <br> The "toggle" is used to add elements if they are already added to the page and remove it if it is already added. <br> To access any css property on the page, we'll use the the style property and we do that by doing style, dot(.) and the name of the property and give it the change we want to give it. </p>
